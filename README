=======

Alt-src is tool used to push patches in provided srpms into centos git.

Script checkouts centos repository for the package on specified branch. Input rpm is then
unpacked and all sources specified in spec file are staged to copy of git repository.

It's possible to use following type of inputs
local-package <package-filename.src.rpm>
--koji <package-nvr> - package srpm is pulled from configured koji instance
--koji <nvr>:module.src.txt - instead of srpm, modulemd is imported
